<p>i've been feeling strange lately. vacations that go on for too long seem to have this effect on me - without the routine and deadlines that studying give you, i end up feeling super aimless. i also end up isolating myself so easily... besides my family and internet friends, the most interaction i've been having has been saying 'good day' to strangers and nothing else. (and even with family, it's difficult to be sincere; and my friends almost all are in other timezones and busy when i'm free.)</p><p><br></p><p>working on the site has helped fill the void a little bit. i've been reading and watching new things as well - i've started mononoke at my friend's recommendation, and i've picked up moby dick recently. tomorrow i plan on going to the library to borrow their english copy of it... i won't be able to read it in french LMAO</p><p><br></p><p>here's to hoping my mood improves soon</p>
